# Challenge 2 - Publish ContosoMasks website

[< Previous Challenge [1]](./Challenge01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge [3] >](./Challenge03.md)

## Pre-requisites

- Azure subscription
- Your own GitHub repo with the source code of ContosoMasks

## Introduction

We're going to setup a copy of the original Contoso Masks website. 

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

In order for us to get started, let's talk a few basics. Web Browsers are the general clients used to interact with Web Sites. For a Web Browser to load a web site, generally you need the following:
- A Domain Name System (DNS) Name
  - This lets your Web Browser take ***www.contosomasks.com*** and turn that into an IP Address to then talk to.
- Something to host your content/website
  - There are lots of choices to run the application code and/or store the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files.

Azure App Service hosting the **www** Web site of your instance of Contoso Masks.
